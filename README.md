# Py_Proj_repo
Sprint 4 Intermediate Python Project

- This repo's primary function is writing to render. A framework for easily setting up web apps. The specific use case for this is to analyze a dataset of Vehicles and their various properties. 

- Dataset is loaded using os library to not have to worry about where the file is located or any potential issues locating it. 

- Missing and duplicated values have been checked for and dealt with accordingly. 

- Multiple visualization types have been shown for a basic exploratory data analysis. 

- Some of these visualtions have been integrated with the framework's various input methods to allow user interactivity. 

- Had to add 'pyarrow==12.0.1' to requirements.txt to resolve issue when deploying to render.
